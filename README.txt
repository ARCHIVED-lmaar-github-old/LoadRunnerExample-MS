LoadRunner sample code.

*** LoadRunner_MSExample ***
This is real demo code which was created against the legacy myspace.com platform in
order to demonstrate complex LoadRunner logic. This code did a search request and
could then send "Friend Requests" to anyone matching designated search criteria.

This also demonstrates "crawler"/"spider" functionality.
